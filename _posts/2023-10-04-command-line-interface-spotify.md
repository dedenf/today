Having to work with command line to interact with infrastructure, it's convenience not to leave CLI and still listening to a music, that's when recently i found this project, a spotify application client using a CLI, i'm using iTerm for terminal with `tmux` installed.

Download the package here [https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player), or you just install it using `brew install spotify_player`.
