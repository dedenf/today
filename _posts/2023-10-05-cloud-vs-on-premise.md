Recently listening on [this podcast](https://podcasts.bcast.fm/e/489v0mqn-episode-29-david-heinemeier-hansson-37-signals-ruby-on-rails-rent-vs-buy-do-cloud-providers-really-save-companies-money) (or [watch, if it’s on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYIJYtPUJwY)) from Cloud Unplugged, they had an interview with [The DHH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson), the creator of ruby on rails, and how his company decided to migrate from Cloud to comeback using on-premise solution.

This conversation packed with how 37Signals as company, and DHH thinking about the pros and cons about abandoning cloud altogether, even it’s not all of their service, still some small parts deployed in the cloud.

This move is not for everyone, and it’s quite fascinating conversation.
